# TickTick MCP Server

A [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server for TickTick that enables interacting with your TickTick task management system directly through Claude and other MCP clients.

## Features

- 📋 View all your TickTick projects and tasks
- ✏️ Create new projects and tasks through natural language
- 🔄 Update existing task details (title, content, dates, priority)
- ✅ Mark tasks as complete
- 🗑️ Delete tasks and projects
- 🔄 Full integration with TickTick's open API
- 🔌 Seamless integration with Claude and other MCP clients

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Fast Python package installer and resolver
- TickTick account with API access
- TickTick API credentials (Client ID, Client Secret, Access Token)

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jacepark12/ticktick-mcp.git
   cd ticktick-mcp
   ```

2. **Install with uv**:
   ```bash
   # Install uv if you don't have it already
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

   # Create a virtual environment
   uv venv

   # Activate the virtual environment
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows:
   .venv\Scripts\activate

   # Install the package
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Authenticate with TickTick**:
   ```bash
   # Run the authentication flow
   uv run -m ticktick_mcp.cli auth
   ```

   This will:
   - Ask for your TickTick Client ID and Client Secret
   - Open a browser window for you to log in to TickTick
   - Automatically save your access tokens to a `.env` file

4. **Test your configuration**:
   ```bash
   uv run test_server.py
   ```
   This will verify that your TickTick credentials are working correctly.

## Authentication with TickTick

This server uses OAuth2 to authenticate with TickTick. The setup process is straightforward:

1. Register your application at the [TickTick Developer Center](https://developer.ticktick.com/manage)
   - Set the redirect URI to `http://localhost:8000/callback`
   - Note your Client ID and Client Secret

2. Run the authentication command:
   ```bash
   uv run -m ticktick_mcp.cli auth
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to enter your Client ID and Client Secret

4. A browser window will open for you to authorize the application with your TickTick account

5. After authorizing, you'll be redirected back to the application, and your access tokens will be automatically saved to the `.env` file

The server handles token refresh automatically, so you won't need to reauthenticate unless you revoke access or delete your `.env` file.

## Usage with Claude for Desktop

1. Install [Claude for Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
2. Edit your Claude for Desktop configuration file:

   **macOS**:
   ```bash
   nano ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

   **Windows**:
   ```bash
   notepad %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

3. Add the TickTick MCP server configuration, using absolute paths:
   ```json
   {
      "mcpServers": {
         "ticktick": {
            "command": "<absolute path to uv>",
            "args": ["run", "--directory", "<absolute path to ticktick-mcp directory>", "-m", "ticktick_mcp.cli", "run"]
         }
      }
   }
   ```

4. Restart Claude for Desktop

Once connected, you'll see the TickTick MCP server tools available in Claude, indicated by the 🔨 (tools) icon.

## Example Prompts for Claude

Here are some example prompts to use with Claude after connecting the TickTick MCP server:

- "Show me all my TickTick projects"
- "Create a new task called 'Finish MCP server documentation' in my work project with high priority"
- "List all tasks in my personal project"
- "Mark the task 'Buy groceries' as complete"
- "Create a new project called 'Vacation Planning' with a blue color"
- "When is my next deadline in TickTick?"

```

### Authentication Flow

The project implements a complete OAuth 2.0 flow for TickTick:

1. **Initial Setup**: User provides their TickTick API Client ID and Secret
2. **Browser Authorization**: User is redirected to TickTick to grant access
3. **Token Reception**: A local server receives the OAuth callback with the authorization code
4. **Token Exchange**: The code is exchanged for access and refresh tokens
5. **Token Storage**: Tokens are securely stored in the local `.env` file
6. **Token Refresh**: The client automatically refreshes the access token when it expires

This simplifies the user experience by handling the entire OAuth flow programmatically.
